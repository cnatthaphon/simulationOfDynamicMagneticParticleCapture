# COMSOL Model File for Simulation of dynamic magnetic particle capture and accumulation around a ferromagnetic wire

## Description
This repository contains COMSOL model file for simulating the dynamic capture and accumulation of magnetic particles around a ferromagnetic wire. The model was developed as a part of the research published in the Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials ([DOI: 10.1016/j.jmmm.2016.12.033](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2016.12.033)).
